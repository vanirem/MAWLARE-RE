This is a straightforward lab that performs various anti-debugging checks.
The objective of this lab is to attempt running the application while it is being debugged and successfully bypass all checks to continue execution until completion.
This exercise will help you become familiar with common anti-debugging techniques employed by malware. 
If you fail, the function check will be invoked repeatedly until you successfully pass the debugger-check.

Hope the upgrade it with more checks soon.
